A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 


So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree
- Turing Machine

I have implemented a total of `24 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.  

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Archimedes Spiral
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Derangement
  - Fast Exponentiation
  - Stirling Number of Second Kind

- Turing Machine
  - Bitwise NOT
  - Increment one
  - 2's Compliment




I am not sure if anyone would like to contribute to this project or not. But any kind of contribution are welcomes. Also if you like this please start this repo. It keeps me motivated.

### Special Features addition timeline

- Commit 16: Added Flip Move animation to inplace sorting components
